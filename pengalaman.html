<p> Hello everyone!!. <p> WHAT am I gonna cook tomorrow. And the next day?” “What can i do during the MCO?? “I can’t go shopping with my mum?” “What? MCO has been extended?” </font> </center>
<center> <font size="4" color="black" face="arial"> Yes, the wailings and angst that accompanied the announcement on TV that the MCO or Movement Control Order had been extended because we, Malaysians, have been terribly degil were most palpable.
